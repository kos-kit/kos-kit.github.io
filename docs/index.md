# Introduction

KOS Kit is a toolkit for working with Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) such as the [UNESCO Thesaurus](https://vocabularies.unesco.org/browser/thesaurus/en/), the [HASSET Thesaurus](https://hasset.ukdataservice.ac.uk/hasset/en/), and other systems defined in [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/).

The toolkit consists of:

- a standalone web application, the KOS Kit Explorer, for browsing and searching Knowledge Organization Systems
- an optional server that exposes large datasets to the Explorer using SPARQL and search endpoints for the Explorer
